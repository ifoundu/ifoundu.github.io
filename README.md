# Hello ~
Welcome to my practice page which is the first site page for me to put on the internet.


Code has the power to delight the meaning of my life.
And only code can work this way, as it delights the meaning of all the other things,
as I never felt before from other things that they make me completed.
I hope I would stay in the world of coding. I believe I can. At least, I will try all that I can.
